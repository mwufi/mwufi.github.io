By explicitly rotating (e.g. multiplying by a matrix) the latent vector during training, it can be taught to be interpretable in that way. So during test time, we can feed it a test vector and it'll produce a depth map of a transformed perspective.</li>\n<li>Use the target depth map to render the image! The hard part is pretty done, now we just have to use the result to render an image. Basically pick which colors go to which pixels, depending on this super useful depth we get.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of these works cite [MaximTatarchenko,AlexeyDosovitskiy,andThomasBrox], who did this thing in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>KITTI</strong>\nIn total there are 18560 images for training and 4641 images for testing. We construct training pairs by randomly selecting target view among 10 nearest frames of source view. The relative transformation is obtained from the global camera poses</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Neural image rendering"},"excerpt":"SynSin\nThey take the discriminator from the following: High-Resolution Image Synthesis and Semantic Manipulation with Conditional GANs (201â€¦"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/machine-learning/neural-image-rendering/neural-image-rendering/"}}}
